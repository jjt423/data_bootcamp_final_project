Data Bootcamp Final Project

This project was completed by Joseph Taied in partial fulfillment of ECON-UB-0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description

The goal of this project is to investigate the two sides of President Trump's Twitter account: his activity, and the engagements with his tweets by his followers. I will use five bar graphs to visualize trends the following metrics as a function of time:

* Mean Number of Tweets per Week versus Time
* Total Number of Tweets per Hour
* Retweet Percentage versus Hour of Day
* Number of Engagements versus Hour of Day
* Mean Favorite-to-Retweet Ratio per Month versus Time


The first three graphs will analyze President Trump's twitter habits with time as the independent variable. The last two graphs will analyze how Trump's followers engage with his tweets (as measured by favorites, retweets), again with time as the independent variable.
